      " content: “Machine Learning for Beginners” by Microsoft is a project-based, introductory curriculum that teaches classical ML with Python and scikit-learn—deliberately avoiding deep learning. Organized as 26 lessons over 12 weeks, it blends short readings, knowledge checks, and coding assignments with end-to-end mini-projects (including a simple web app) to reinforce practice. Datasets and examples span global contexts, and many lessons have R equivalents. You’ll progress from fundamentals and regression to classification, clustering, NLP, time series, and reinforcement learning, with frequent quizzes and structured challenges to solidify concepts. The repository includes solutions, a quiz app, translation support, and guidance for both self-learners and instructors. [...] Start with Google Machine Learning Crash Course, Microsoft ML for Beginners, or Fast.ai Practical Deep Learning for Coders. These courses teach ML concepts with minimal math prerequisites. Once you’re comfortable, you can take the Mathematics for ML Specialization to deepen your understanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely! All courses listed offer free access to materials. Certificates are optional and mainly useful for LinkedIn/resume credentials. Your portfolio projects (especially from ML Zoomcamp or FreeCodeCamp) will be more valuable to employers than certificates. [...] “Machine Learning Crash Course” by Google is a practical introduction to ML that combines short videos, interactive demos, and coding exercises. Core modules cover linear and logistic regression, binary classification metrics, and data preparation for numerical and categorical features (including one-hot, feature hashing, mean encoding, and feature crosses), plus generalization and overfitting. Advanced modules introduce neural networks, embeddings, and a primer on large language models (tokens, Transformers, training basics). Real-world tracks address production ML systems, AutoML, and ML fairness, emphasizing deployment considerations and responsible practice.\n",

      " content: you guys about the free resource after the next step of our road map. So, step four, explore advanced supervised learning techniques. Once you're confident with the basics, it's time to move one step further and explore some advanced machine learning algorithms. These models are more powerful and can handle complex problems better. Start with Nive Base, a simple but effective algorithm that's great for working with text data like detecting spam emails or classifying news articles. It's fast, easy to understand, and works surprisingly well in many real world tasks. Next, learn about support vector machines or SVMs. These models are especially useful when you're working with data that has many features. These models are especially useful when you're working with data that has many features. [...] without wasting any time, let's get started with the very first step in your machine learning journey. That is to build a strong foundation in math. And by strong foundation, I don't mean you need to be an expert in every topic. Rather, you just need to be comfortable with a few key areas. Start with linear algebra, which deals with vectors and matrices. These are used in almost every machine learning algorithm. So, understanding how they work is essential. Then move on to calculus. It helps you understand how models learn and improve, especially when it comes to concepts like derivatives and gradients which are used in model optimization. Next, focus on basic statistics. It will help you understand your data, compare results, and measure how well your models are performing. Finally, [...] the libraries I mentioned, I have created full courses on numpai, pandas, mattplot liib, and seabon. You can find them directly on YouTube or on Intellipath's channel. Step three, get started with supervised learning. Once you're comfortable with Python, it's time to step into the world of machine learning. Starting with supervised learning. This is the most common type of machine learning where the model learns from label data. In simple terms, the data you feed into the model already has the answers and the model learns to predict those answers for new data. You'll start with basic algorithms like linear regression and logistic regression. These help you solve simple prediction problems like predicting a number or classifying data into categories. After that, you learn about\n",

It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.\\n\\nFor a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual.

It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.\\n\\nThe Glossary is also worth going through.', 'score': 0.8342047}, {'title': 'Python Tutorials - YouTube', 'url': 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU', 'content': '•\\n\\n21\\n\\n12:07\\n\\n12:07\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Sorting Lists, Tuples, and Objects\\n\\n•\\n\\n297K views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n22\\n\\n13:53\\n\\n13:53\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: String Formatting - Advanced Operations for Dicts, Lists, Numbers, and Dates\\n\\n•\\n\\n339K views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n23\\n\\n19:14\\n\\n19:14\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: OS Module - Use Underlying Operating System Functionality\\n\\n•\\n\\n1M views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n24\\n\\n27:49\\n\\n27:49\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Datetime Module - How to work with Dates, Times, Timedeltas, and Timezones\\n\\n•\\n\\n576K views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n25\\n\\n24:33\\n\\n24:33\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: File Objects - Reading and Writing to Files\\n\\n•\\n\\n2M views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n26\\n\\n12:34\\n\\n12:34\\n\\nNow playing [...] •\\n\\n2.1M views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n57\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Unit Testing Your Code with the unittest Module\\n\\n•\\n\\n1.4M views • 8 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n58\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Pipenv - Easily Manage Packages and Virtual Environments\\n\\n•\\n\\n265K views • 7 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n59\\n\\n### Preparing for a Python Interview: 10 Things You Should Know\\n\\n•\\n\\n984K views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n60\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Else Clauses on Loops\\n\\n•\\n\\n50K views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n61\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Image Manipulation with Pillow\\n\\n•\\n\\n416K views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n62\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Custom Sublime Text Build Systems\\n\\n•\\n\\n119K views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n63\\n\\n### Python: Ex Machina Easter Egg - Hidden Message within the Code\\n\\n•\\n\\n31K views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n64 [...] •\\n\\n1.1M views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n16\\n\\n20:49\\n\\n20:49\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: How I Manage Multiple Projects, Virtual Environments, and Environment Variables\\n\\n•\\n\\n158K views • 8 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n17\\n\\n30:21\\n\\n30:21\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Jupyter Notebook Tutorial: Introduction, Setup, and Walkthrough\\n\\n•\\n\\n2.2M views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n18\\n\\n20:59\\n\\n20:59\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Variable Scope - Understanding the LEGB rule and global/nonlocal statements\\n\\n•\\n\\n395K views • 9 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n19\\n\\n10:44\\n\\n10:44\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Slicing Lists and Strings\\n\\n•\\n\\n485K views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n20\\n\\n18:29\\n\\n18:29\\n\\nNow playing\\n\\n### Python Tutorial: Comprehensions - How they work and why you should be using them\\n\\n•\\n\\n567K views • 10 years ago\\n\\n•\\n\\n21\\n\\n12:07\\n\\n12:07\\n\\nNow playing', 'score': 0.7811474}]\n",
